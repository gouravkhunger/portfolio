Dear Sir/Madam,

I have known Roberto for year and a half now thanks to the Formula SAE team in which he is in charge of the Frame and Aerodynamics Division now. I was one of his Aerodynamic professors and, currently, I am the supervisor of his final degree project, consisting in an aerodynamic study and optimization of the Formula SAE front and rear wings through an ANSYS Fluent simulation. This situation has allowed me knowing Roberto very well, academically and personally.

Apart from his grades being remarkable he has also shown, in numerous occasions, aptitudes and interest in advanced studies in Aerodynamics, Fluid Mechanics and Aerospace Structures, going far beyond the regular knowledge taught in the University courses.

As a result of managing a team of 15 students in the FSAE team, Roberto has acquired a brilliant ability to communicate effectively and he is moreover a good team player. He has demonstrated a great maturity according to his academic performance with respect to other students.

Furthermore, I consider he is capable of dealing with any kind of circumstance thanks to his constancy and capability of understanding the base of the problem. I believe he has reached a perfect point in his education to face a new challenge such as moving to US to pursue a PhD degree.

In my opinion he is more than ready to undertake a programme of the highest quality and therefore I strongly recommend him.

Please, do not hesitate to contact me if you require further information.

Yours faithfully,

Rodolfo Sant

Aircraft and Space Vehicles Department Deputy Director
