Dear Mr. Meurisse

Over the last two years I have come to know Roberto Mart´ınez de la Cruz, who has been an
MSc candidate in our group, as well as a teaching assistant for my undergraduate course in
computational modelling.

Since coming to our faculty, Roberto has repeatedly demonstrated high-quality performance. This
has been especially true of our course program, which many students find difficult, yet in which he
has performed well above average. As a teaching assistant, Roberto has also demonstrated skills
which are not directly related to academic achievement. In general is is a good communicator,
and explains even abstract concepts clearly. I have also appreciated his creativity in helping to
create new quiz questions.

In general our Aerodynamics MSc track provides a background which is applicable to many of
the activities at NASA Ames. In the case of Roberto, this has included several advanced courses
in computational fluid dynamics, at which he has excelled.

In summary, I would not hesitate to recommend Roberto for a position at your research centre.
With kind regards,

S. J. Hulshoff

Assistant Professor, Aerodynamics Group
