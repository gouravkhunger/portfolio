<div class="text-center">
Furls and fantasies held hostage,<br />
courtesy to the brain.<br />
What would give the courage,<br />
To unfold the strain?
<br /><br />
In a moment's delight held high to the sky,<br />
Then down again, back to the narrow strait.<br />
An interesting mystery,<br />
Unknown even to the sane.
<br /><br />
Thriving entanglement in mental traps,<br />
Doesn't understand: the world ain't your anyways.<br />
Destined alone with empty hands,<br />
That is the rhythm nature will follow, always.
<br /><br />
All in all, bound to time's desire.<br />
A day shall come, not of pain,<br />
Where things unroll through a lively satire,<br />
Letting go, of the inmost hurricane.<br />
<br />
