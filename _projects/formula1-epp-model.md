With the aim of testing in a 'home made windtunnel' one of 
the paper and Solidworks CAD designs, a real model at 1/10th scale was built.
Expanded Polypropylene (EPP) was chosen since it was easy to shape, glue and lightweight, 
besides being found easily in the new furniture packages my parents have ordered. 

Given the holes that transported air from the front of the car to the difusor, sectioning 
of the EPP blocks had to be done carefully. Around 20 blocks were cut using a home-made hot 
wire, ready to be shaped with sand-paper and wood glue. 

After hours of removing material, taping broken pieces and cutting carboard templates, the blocks were ready to be assembled.
The wheels were attached to the bodywork via suspension triangles constructed with eating wooden sticks.

The scale positioned under the model while it was blown in the 'wind-tunnel' did not give the amount of downforce
naively desired by its designer, but a good looking model remained to decor the shelfs of his room. The R416, the next
generation of Formula 1 vehicles
