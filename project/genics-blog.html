I started out with WordPress, trying dev.to, medium, hashnode alongside. But well nothing suited me.</p> <p>WordPress was slow even with decent hosting plans, but had a recurring cost which didn’t provide enough value for investment. dev.to’s primary focus wasn’t technical writing, they allow everything: discussions, cross-postings, articles so things seemed cluttered.</p> <p>Medium wasn’t well suited for developers. Code blocks were hard to read, and the design was a bit clunky. Load times were super bad back then. Hashnode didn’t allow removing footer branding even with some paid plan, so that was a no-go.</p> <p>Plus, I always wanted to be blogging with my friends on a single platform as WordPress supports.</p> <p>I knew the site had to be a static site, considering it should be fast to load and well as soon as I found jekyll, I started tinkering and built different static sites with it!</p> <p>Once I got comfortable I built Genics’ theme from ground up. The tech stack involves: HTML, TailwindCSS, Ruby, Python, Docker, Jekyll and all of the built assets are hosted completely free on GitHub Pages.</p> <h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2> <h3 id="no-possibility-for-multiple-authors">No possibility for multiple authors</h3> <p>I realised Jekyll was actually powerful to create powerful static websites. The only problem was, multiple authors, with paginated author pages, as I wished weren’t possible. But that problem as well, I fixed by building <a href="/project/jekyll-auto-authors">jekyll-auto-authors</a> plugin!</p> <h3 id="writing-experience-was-bad">Writing experience was bad</h3> <p>Soon as the code-base grew, we needed to separate the articles from the theme code. Otherwise the main repository was cluttered and new authors were finding hard to navigate.</p> <p>This meant we either needed to create a mono-repo separating the theme and the articles, or we had to create a separate repository for both articles and code.</p> <p>I chose the latter, as it was easier to maintain and I wanted to keep the theme code as clean as possible.</p> <p>We use docker to setup local environments. Checkout docker files for <a href="https://github.com/genicsblog/genicsblog.com/blob/main/Dockerfile" target="_blank">main repo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/genicsblog/theme-files/blob/main/Dockerfile" target="_blank">theme-files repo</a>. Essentially, both do the process of combining code with articles behind the scenes so that articles and theme code can be worked on separately.</p> <h2 id="current-stats">Current stats</h2> <p>The blog is <a href="https://github.com/genicsblog" target="_blank">open source</a> at heart. And this transparency has lead to a lot of growth, from 200 monthly readers to 700+ within 3 months.</p> <p>We primarily rely on organic traffic, which constitutes almost half of the total traffic.</p> <h2 id="the-future">The future</h2> <p>Currently, we are focused on publishing a lot quality content (the reason each submission is reviewed twice before being published).This sets up a solid base for the future. We plan to grow our userbase and keep providing value through content!</p> <h2 id="questions">Questions?</h2> <p>Do reach out to <a href="https://twitter.com/genicsblog" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@genicsblog</a> (Twitter) or <a href="mailto:contact@genicsblog.com">contact@genicsblog.com</a> (E-mail).</p> </div> </main> <footer> <p>Copyright &copy; 2022 Gourav Khunger</p> <p>This website is <a href="https://github.com/gouravkhunger/portfolio" target="_blank">open source</a></p> </footer> <script src="/assets/js/theme.js" data-no-instant></script> <script src="/assets/js/instantclick.min.js" data-no-instant></script> <script data-no-instant>InstantClick.on("change",()=>{setTheme(),document.getElementsByClassName("theme-toggle")[0].addEventListener("click",()=>{saveTheme(isDark()?LIGHT:DARK)});const e=document.getElementsByClassName("burgers")[0],s=document.getElementsByClassName("mobile-nav")[0];e.addEventListener("click",()=>{e.classList.toggle("closed"),s.classList.toggle("hidden"),s.classList.toggle("flex")})}),InstantClick.init("mousedown");</script> </body> </html>
